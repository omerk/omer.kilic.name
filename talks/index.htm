### Fast and Furious: Overclocking chips for fun and profit

  - [OSHUG #30 — Manufacturing](http://oshug.org/event/30) (London, November 2013)

		<span><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-double-down"></i> Abstract</span>
		<span></span>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
Due to the variance in silicon manufacturing technologies, integrated circuits used in everyday
designs are usually spec’ed at lower speeds than their actual capabilities. It is, therefore, not
unlikely for chips to run faster than their advertised speeds, sometimes at significant margins with
a little push. The umbrella term used for this practice is overclocking and it encapsulates a
variety of techniques from simply increasing the clock speed to employing elaborate systems with
liquid nitrogen cooling.


This talk will provide an overview of overclocking and overvolting techniques — investigating
the effects of forcing chips to run faster on the silicon level — and present vftweak: an open
source hardware design that aims to simplify experimenting with circuits by providing a programmable
interface and monitoring tools.

### Cloud, Distributed, Embedded: Erlang in the Heterogeneous Computing World

	</div>

	<div class="content">
The future of computing will be heterogeneous and the traditional tools we are used to will not be
able to handle the different paradigms required when developing for these systems. This talk will
provide a brief overview of heterogeneous computing and discuss how Erlang can help with the
orchestration of different processing platforms, using our latest experiment on the Parallella
platform as a case study.
 
This talk will also introduce Erlang/ALE, our new framework for embedded systems and provide an
update on the Erlang Embedded project.

The Actor Model has interesting properties that could be used for dealing with complexities posed by
modern embedded systems. Using actors as compositional units to describe these systems is a new
proposal which stands out and challenges conventional approaches.
 
This talk will demonstrate how, creating a layered architecture for hardware modules and
partitioning up complex systems in smaller units, testing becomes much easier, runtime errors are
contained, and the architecture becomes maintainable.

### Taking Back Embedded: The Erlang Embedded Framework

  - [Erlang Factory SF Bay Area 2013](http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2013/speakers/OmerKilic) (San Francisco, March 2013)

<div class="container">
	<div class="header">
		<span><i class="fa fa-fw fa-angle-double-down"></i> Abstract</span>
		<span></span>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
Erlang was originally designed to control telephony switches at Ericsson which, by definition, are
embedded systems. Somewhere along the line the application area changed dramatically and now Erlang
is being used to tackle challenges which involve gratuitous amount of parallelism and “The Cloud”.
 
The Internet of Things is the physical extension of cloud which describes how everyday objects
around us will become sources of data that will transform our daily lives. Analysts forecast the
number of Internet connected devices to reach 50 billion within the next decade, which signifies
that we need to think of new ways to architect these new generation of connected devices.
 
This talk will demonstrate how, by creating a layered architecture for hardware modules and
partitioning up complex systems in smaller units, testing becomes easier, runtime errors are
contained and the architecture becomes maintainable. Using Erlang processes as compositional units
to describe these systems is a new proposal which stands out and challenges conventional approaches.

### Erlang Embedded — Concurrent Blinkenlights and More!

  - [OSHUG #22 — Embedded](http://oshug.org/event/22) (London, November 2012)

	</div>

	<div class="content">
Managing the resources and utilising the increasingly popular multi-core and heterogeneous aspects
of modern embedded systems require new sets of tools and methodologies that differ from the
traditional C/C++ flow.
 
Erlang provides features that are highly relevant to solve these issues and yet it is pretty much
unknown in the embedded domain — which is surprising considering that it was originally designed for
embedded applications at Ericsson!
 
This talk aims to provide an overview of Erlang and the current state of its usage in the embedded
domain and talk about our plans to help speed up the adoption rate of Erlang in embedded projects.

### Interfacing the Raspberry Pi to the World — Everything you need to know about P1

	<div class="content">
You’ve received your Pi, set up a web server on it and maybe played a few rounds of Quake.  You’re
looking for a new challenge and suddenly the header on the corner of the board catches your eye. A
quick Google search for “P1 Raspbery Pi” gets you to the eLinux wiki page on Low level peripherals,
and you suddenly realise that you can do all sorts of fun stuff by adding extra bits to your
Raspberry Pi using this magical expansion port. Where do you start? Is it safe to connect a motor
directly to the pins? What sort of interesting components are out there?
 
In this talk we will look at the ways we can communicate with the outside world using the GPIO pins
on the Raspberry Pi. We will explore the mechanical, electrical and software side of things and talk
about a few example projects you can try at home, and the hardware limitations will be covered and
workarounds provided.

### A Brief Introduction to Programmable Logic

	</div>

	<div class="content">
Programmable Logic Devices – mainly FPGAs – are frequently utilised in high speed and
computationally intensive applications, and with modern devices containing several million
transistors and many gigabits/second of connectivity they are becoming increasingly popular in the
race to achieve exascale computing power.
 
But what does this all mean and how can FPGAs achieve this processing power? How do they differ from
the good old CPUs we have in our everyday computers?
 
In essence, an FPGA is a device that contains configurable blocks of logic along with flexible
interconnect between these blocks. They can be configured to contain exactly and only those
operations that appear in the algorithms employed in a particular application, which can potentially
give them quite a bit of an advantage in terms of throughput and efficiency when compared to static
instruction set processors such as a traditional x86 CPU.
 
In this short introductory talk we will cover the basics of programmable logic devices and talk
about the design, synthesis, simulation, implementation and programming cycles associated with FPGA
projects.

entry being lowered by projects such as the Raspberry Pi.

In this hands on tutorial we will design an Erlang powered embedded sensor node, running on the

		<span></span>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
This hands-on session will introduce how to do embedded programming using the Erlang/ALE framework
created by Erlang Solutions.Erlang/ALE is an Actor Library for Embedded for the Erlang programming
language targeted initially for the Raspberry Pi. It provides access to the various embedded
interfaces (such as GPIO, I2C, SPI, etc) exposed on the Raspberry Pi from Erlang in a way that sits
well with the Erlang and functional programming idioms.Erlang’s support for concurrency and
functional programming is very well suited for modern embedded systems that consist of many internal
and external peripherals (such as sensors and actuators).Most of the session is focused on using
Erlang/ALE to do hands-on exercises with a custom extension board for the Raspberry Pi but a brief
overview of the embedded ecosystem and what it entails to do embedded programming on devices such as
the Raspberry Pi will also be presented.
